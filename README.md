# Noughts & Crosses
This is my implementation of the popular game Noughts & Crosses, also known as TicTacToe.
This is an android application that should run on all versions after API 15. The GUI is designed to scale with the size of the screen, so the tiles in the game should appear in the same proportion regardless of the actual screen size of the device.
